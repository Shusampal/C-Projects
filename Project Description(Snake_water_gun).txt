Project Title - Snake_water_gun

Project Description-
This project involves generating a random number between 1 to 100 ( Both included )
which is hidden from user . There are 3 characters in the project which are as follows-
's' for snake , 'w' for water and 'g' for gun. Two variables are created in the program to
store computer value and input from user respectively. If the randomly generated number
is less than 33 , then computer choose 's' , if this number is above 33 and less than 66 , 
then the computer choose 'w' and if this number is more than 66 and less than 100 , then
the computer chooses 'g'. Now the character of both input and computer is compared.
Logic is if there is comparison between snake and water , then snake wins. if there is 
comparison between snake and gun, then gun wins. if there is comparison between 
water and gun, then water wins . according to this comparison , integer is returned and
program displays who wins the game (whether user or computer).In case both character
happens to be same , then the match is draw .
